# Welcome to LivingPark!

LivingPark is a project to improve the generalizability and robustness of MRI-derived biomarkers of Parkinson's Disease through analytical and data variability evaluations.
It started in March 2022 and is currently funded by the [Michael J Fox Foundation](https://www.michaeljfox.org). The first objective of the project is to 
replicate the following MRI measures of Parkinson's Disease and make them available as [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org).

We'd love to hear from you! Feel free to reach out by posting an issue in any of our repos, or by email at [livingpark@lists.concordia.ca](mailto:livingpark@lists.concordia.ca)

The following table points to the on-going replication efforts.

🟥 could not replicate the original result 🟧 partially replicated the original result 🏃 work in progress

To facilitate the development of these notebooks we develop [livingpark-utils](https://github.com/LivingPark-MRI/livingpark-utils), a collection of functions to help work with PPMI data. We also develop [ppmi-scraper](https://github.com/LivingPark-MRI/ppmi-scraper), a set of utilities to download PPMI study and imaging data.
